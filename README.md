# Aura
Aura IDE is a minimalistic and simple IDE built on top of Electron.js. It is open-source and focuses on maximum speed and security with a minimalistic design. This IDE allows developers to write code efficiently and provides the means to edit, debug, and run code in one user-friendly interface. The use of Electron.js makes it cross-platform, which means it is available for different operating systems.
